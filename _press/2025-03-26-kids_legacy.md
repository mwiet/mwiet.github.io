citation: '"The Kilo-Degree Survey has said its last word on one of the most polarising tensions in cosmology! The final KiDS results reconcile early- and late-Universe measurements of the distribution of dark matter in the Universe. As we enter the golden era of gravitational lensing with surveys such as Euclid, this analysis drives the state-of-the-art of weak lensing cosmology and teaches us important lessons for the future." - MvWK'
