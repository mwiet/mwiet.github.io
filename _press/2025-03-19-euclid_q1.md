citation: '"These observations are tremendously exciting: they demonstrate the capabilities of this precision instrument, while already pushing the cutting-edge in astrophysics. Among the results, it is astonishing that Euclid has already discovered 500 gravitational lens candidates substantially adding to the total of approximately 1,000 previously known lensed galaxies, which took over 40 years to discover! At this rate, Euclid is expected to observe 200,000 such objects over six years of the survey. These observations, together with the two billion galaxies Euclid will image, will help us understand how dark matter is distributed in the Universe and may allow us to uncover its nature. " - MvWK'
