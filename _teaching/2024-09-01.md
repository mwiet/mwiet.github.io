Convening and demonstrating of two weekly workshops as part of the 2nd-year undergraduate course ["Theoretical Physics 2" (PHYS2631)](https://apps.dur.ac.uk/faculty.handbook/2024/UG/module/PHYS2631) over two terms. The course covers calculus of varations, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, symmetry principles and advanced quantum theory. Each workshop involves demonstrating a problem set to approx. 40 students, and present the answers to the questions.
